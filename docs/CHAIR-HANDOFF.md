# Chair authenticator recovery and handoff

For a trusted project operator with database and Supabase administration access. Ordinary members and the Chair cannot run this through the portal. Never turn off MFA merely because someone knows the Chair email or password; first verify that the chapter authorizes the incoming officeholder or lost-device recovery.

The pause below is reversible and only suspends the selected Chair office account. It signs that account out everywhere and blocks new Chair sign-ins until the operator resumes it. Ordinary members remain active, and academic records are preserved. Arrange this with the Chair; do not pause a live account as a test.

## Procedure

1. Prepare a private, explicitly selected environment file containing the correct database configuration. Keep it out of Git, logs and chat. Inspect the target project/environment before any mutation. These examples use a placeholder path; do not paste a database password into the command line.

   ```sh
   node --env-file=/secure/path/portal.env scripts/chair-access.mjs inspect
   ```

   This read-only command lists Chair member IDs, names, emails and active status. Verify the exact office account and select its **portal member ID**, not an Auth UID, name or email. The script requires PostgreSQL configuration and has no local-data fallback.

2. Pause that exact account with the displayed member ID:

   ```sh
   node --env-file=/secure/path/portal.env scripts/chair-access.mjs suspend MEMBER_ID "SUSPEND CHAIR"
   ```

   Proceed only after the result says `suspended` and `portalSessionsRevoked: true`. The transaction locks chapter state, marks the account inactive, revokes its sessions and pending MFA, and changes its sign-in generation so an earlier password/MFA request cannot complete afterward. A concurrent security update may require waiting before retrying. Do not remove the provider factor if the pause failed.

3. While suspended, use trusted Supabase administration to remove the intended lost/previous Chair TOTP factor from the exact bound Auth user. Use trusted provider administration to rotate the office account password, and hand over the chapter inbox/recovery access. The suspended account cannot complete a normal portal reset link; this intentionally prevents a self-service bypass. The script does **not** remove provider factors, reset passwords, email anyone or modify the chapter roster. Do not delete/recreate the Auth user: its stable binding must remain intact.

4. After verifying the chapter-approved handoff and provider changes, explicitly resume the same member ID:

   ```sh
   node --env-file=/secure/path/portal.env scripts/chair-access.mjs resume MEMBER_ID "VERIFIED CHAIR HANDOFF"
   ```

   Resume requires an already suspended Chair account, revokes any stale sessions again, and changes the sign-in generation. It cannot bypass MFA: if a verified factor remains at Supabase, the Chair still needs it. If the operator removed the factor, the next password login shows enrollment.

5. Have the incoming Chair sign in privately, enroll their authenticator, enter its code and open the Chair view. Confirm that the old password/session no longer works. Record the handoff date and responsible operator privately. Store authenticator/recovery material under chapter control; do not share it in the audit note or chat.

If the process is interrupted, leave the Chair suspended while diagnosing it. `inspect` is safe to repeat. If a legitimate handoff is canceled without provider changes, the trusted operator can explicitly resume after verifying the current Chair; their existing factor is still required. Do not treat an email password reset as recovery from a lost authenticator.

## Local verification

`node private-tests/operations-chair-access.test.mjs` exercises the exact pause/resume function against a disposable fictional database. It checks wrong-ID/confirmation rejection, member access preservation, session/pending-MFA revocation, stale sign-in rejection and audit events. No real Chair account was paused or modified during development. Real Supabase factor removal and incoming-device enrollment still require an authorized acceptance test.

For an ordinary forgotten password when the Chair still has the authenticator, request an email reset and enter the current authenticator code in the portal password form. This does not enroll or replace a factor and does not sign the account in automatically.
