# Launch checklist

This is a working acceptance checklist, not a claim that version 1.0 is approved. Keep member emails, grades, passwords, recovery keys and private backup paths out of this public repository. Record the Chair's real decisions and test-recipient addresses in a chapter-controlled location.

## Pre-meeting verification — October 11, 2026

- 200 automated tests passed, with no failures or skips, using SQLite and an isolated PostgreSQL instance. Source/deployment-file checks and the production dependency audit passed.
- Fictional browser checks covered Chair verification, incorrect-code rejection, resuming verification after reload, direct sign-out, member recovery-key acknowledgment after an interrupted first login, and account repair without sending mail. The Chair verification and member profile layouts were checked at 390 pixels wide.
- The operational rehearsal passed all six backup, restore, interrupted-wipe and retention checks using disposable records and actual fictional file bytes.
- Class-hour API and sandbox checks cover approval, denial, replacements, removals, stale/concurrent reviews, total limits and recalculated pending point estimates. A fictional browser flow verified approval to 3 hours, preserved hours during a removal request, and 0 hours after Chair approval. Class forms fit the 390-pixel layout.
- File previews retain a centered loading cross through image transfer and decoding, omit displayed filenames and support retry. Delayed/cached images and mobile layout were checked. The in-app browser’s PDF fallback was checked; native inline PDF rendering and physical Safari still require acceptance testing.
- Invitation and password-reset email templates were installed in Supabase, previewed, and verified after reloading the settings. Saving templates sent no emails; recipient inbox delivery remains untested.
- These checks used local provider mocks. They do not establish hosted email delivery, real authenticator enrollment, physical iPhone behavior, or production backup/restore readiness. Those remain explicit acceptance items below. No real invitation or reset email was sent during this work.

## Work that does not require the Chair

- Run the automated suite with an isolated PostgreSQL database as well as local SQLite. Include role/ownership checks, syllabus approval, scoring, stale edits, invitations, password recovery and two-factor verification.
- Run `node scripts/rehearse-operations.mjs`. It must report all checks passing and remove its temporary data. It includes actual evidence-file bytes, interrupted deletion, account retention and restoring a backup taken before a wipe.
- Exercise member and Chair screens with fictional data on a narrow screen. Check native activity/class selection, image/PDF upload and preview, cropping, long file names, keyboard navigation, error/retry states, sign-out and loading indicators. Browser emulation does not prove Safari on a physical iPhone.
- Prepare and preview the [invite template](../supabase/email-templates/invite.html) and [reset template](../supabase/email-templates/recovery.html). Installing either template is separate from sending an email.
- Review the [member instructions and FAQ drafts](MEMBER-GUIDE.md). Do not replace Chair-edited live FAQ entries automatically.
- Agree who will operate backups and restore the service, using the [backup runbook](BACKUP-RESTORE.md). A completed rehearsal does not mean scheduled production backups exist.

## Chair meeting: decisions and access

1. **Account and inbox.** Verify the dedicated Chair office login, chapter control of its inbox, authenticator enrollment and a documented transition/recovery process. The previous officeholder's access must end at handoff. Never share the password or authenticator setup code in a meeting note or chat.
2. **Semester.** Confirm semester name, start date, three checkpoint dates, final point deadline and submission closing date. Preview all dates in the portal before saving; do not use semester reset merely to adjust a deadline if real records should remain.
3. **Roster.** Refresh the read-only sheet, confirm active and new members, detect duplicates/mistyped emails, and review deactivated access. Refreshing the roster does not send invitations.
4. **Tiers and credits.** The Chair imports their private GPA CSV, maps its rows/columns, reviews matches and resulting tiers, and applies them. Use the page 5 policy. The portal stores tiers rather than the source GPA sheet or 900 numbers. Members submit credit hours with each class syllabus, and the Chair approves both in **Classes**. Check all classes before reviewing point claims: the first class-hours approval replaces any old manually entered total with the sum of approved classes. Confirm any points earned before rollout.
5. **Rules.** Confirm point categories, checkpoint quotas, evidence requirements and syllabus approval before graded assignments. Confirm who will review submissions and handle denials/corrections.
6. **Privacy and retention.** Choose who can access operational backups, how long backups remain, when old exports are destroyed, and who is responsible for recovery. Semester reset removes live academic records and uploaded files; separately retained backups/downloads follow their own retention schedule.
7. **Pilot recipients.** Select two or three consenting testers with inboxes they control. Separately authorize one invitation and password-reset email test before any bulk rollout. No recipient is implicitly authorized by appearing in the roster.

## Pilot acceptance

Use fictional academic records with the actual hosted workflow. Record pass/fail and the deployed commit privately; do not paste setup links or tokens in screenshots.

- [ ] One authorized recipient receives the invitation with the correct sender, wording and site link; check spam as well as inbox.
- [ ] Recipient chooses a password, saves/acknowledges their recovery key, signs out and signs in again with supported aliases.
- [ ] Expired, interrupted and repeated setup/recovery attempts have clear recovery paths; old sessions cannot retain access after a password reset.
- [ ] The authorized recipient's reset email arrives and completes successfully. The Chair can sign in with their second factor.
- [ ] A member adds a class with credit hours and a syllabus; a pending or denied syllabus blocks graded assignments. Chair approval unlocks the class and updates the account total. Pending replacements and removal requests preserve the previously approved hours until reviewed. Verify the resulting credit-load multiplier before approving point claims.
- [ ] A member submits fictional evidence; the Chair sees the file and original syllabus inline, approves or denies, and the member sees the correct notes and totals.
- [ ] The other member cannot open the first member's direct submission, syllabus, profile-picture or evidence URLs.
- [ ] Test on a physical iPhone/Safari: dropdowns, file picker/camera, portrait/landscape, dialogs, previews and sign-out. Also test desktop.
- [ ] Restore a separate fictional hosted database/object backup in an isolated project; confirm authentication bindings, encryption material, files and post-wipe retention rules. Never run a wipe test against the chapter's live data.
- [ ] Confirm production error monitoring and an operator contact, working backup schedule, and a tested previous-deployment rollback route.

## Version 1.0 decision

Invite the small pilot first. Resolve failed checks, have the Chair accept the policy/date/roster settings, then authorize the remaining invitations in batches compatible with the actual sender limits. Keep a way to pause sending and deactivate mistaken accounts. SMTP configuration and a successful deployment alone do not establish delivery or launch readiness.
